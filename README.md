## About Me

Hello, I'm Arindam Karmakar, a passionate software developer. I'm currently diving deep into system design and looking for collaboration opportunities in Flutter, Swift, and C++. 

## Repository Structure

- This repository, [`k-arindam.github.io`](https://github.com/k-arindam/k-arindam.github.io), contains the compiled Flutter code for my portfolio website.

- The source code of the Flutter project is housed in a separate repository named [`portfolio-source-code`](https://github.com/k-arindam/portfolio-source-code).

## Building the Project

The website is built using Flutter, a UI toolkit by Google. To build the project, you need to have Flutter and Dart installed on your machine. Once installed, you can use the following command to build the project:


```bash
flutter build web
```
